There are cars of every type,
Some sleek, some sturdy, some ripe.
From speedy sports cars to family vans,
There's something for every person's plans.

There are the classic cars of yore,
With shining chrome and engines that roar.
Their vintage charm never grows old,
And their beauty never gets cold.

Then there are the sports cars so fast,
That they leave all others in the past.
Their aerodynamic curves and lines,
Leave admirers in awe every time.

For those who have a family to transport,
There are minivans that fit every sort.
They may not be glamorous, but they're practical,
And make family road trips quite magical.

And finally, for those with a taste for luxury,
There are cars that make driving quite plushy.
Their leather seats and high-end tech,
Make driving a joy, a privilege to trek.

So whether you need speed or space,
Or just want to ride in luxury with grace,
There's a car for every driver's style,
And every mile will be worth your while.
